UECS Packet Transceiver - Quick Guide
Overview
This device displays the direct content of UDP communications between nodes used in UECS.
It also allows you to send text input directly to each node and receive responses.
Usage Precautions
When using only the receiving function, there is minimal risk.
However, when using the transmitting function, misuse can cause confusion in UECS operations and lead to malfunctions.
Please use this in an environment where malfunctions have been anticipated in advance.
The user assumes all responsibility for any damages that may occur from using this software.
Note that it cannot be run simultaneously with applications that have similar functions (such as UECS monitoring software).
Receiving Function
Displays the raw data of packets transmitted between UECS nodes, with line breaks removed.

Packet Filtering

Restrict receive IP:
Will not display packets coming from IPs other than specified.

Ignore IP:
Displays packets from all IPs except the specified one.

Receive specified string:
Only displays packets containing the specified string.
Responds to any partial match in the received string, not limited to CCM.

Ignore specified string:
Does not display packets containing the specified string.
Responds to partial matches, but be careful as setting it to blank will stop all reception.

Output to logfile:
Outputs received packet contents to receive.txt.
Data is appended to the file.

Reception rate:
Number of CCMs received per second.
Displayed regardless of filter settings.
Stop reception on each port:
Configure whether to receive on each of the three ports used by UECS.

Note: Setting the maximum log lines to 0 will prevent logs from being deleted, but this state is not suitable for long-term operation.
Transmission Function
Directly sends the content written in the transmission text to the network.

Destination:
When set, sends only to the specified IP.

Broadcast:
Sends the transmission text to all nodes within the same subnet.

Send once:
Sends at the moment the button is pressed.

Send every second:
Continuously emits the transmission text at 1-second intervals.

Specify send port:
Depending on the content of the transmission text, it may not respond if not sent to the correct port.
Generally divided by purpose as follows:

Measurement data and device internal information transmission:
Data port 16520

CCM source search:
Query port 16521

Network node search:
Scan port 16529
