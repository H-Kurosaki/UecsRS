UECS Packet sending and receiving support tool Ver2.2E
2019.8.9 Kurosaki Hideto
######################################################

●Operating environment
This software has already been confirmed with Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10.
In Windows XP or later, you may be warned about using the network the first time you start up, so please allow communication.
Since this software conflicts with software with same kinds of UDP communication function, it can not start at the same time.

●UDP reception
This software can display the status of UDP communication used by UECS and display the character string received from the 16520, 16521, 16529 port.

Broadcast packets can be received even if the subnet does not match.
Therefore, if a UECS node connected to the PC is running, some character string will be displayed.
(Please be aware that http communication can not be accessed unless subnets are matched)
Broadcast packets and packets other than sent to the IP address of the PC can not be received.
Note: The maximum packet reception speed handled by this tool is up to 200 packets per second.

●UDP transmission
UDP transmission of the character string written in the "Send string to UDP" field.
You can select broadcast or unicast.
When you press the "send once" button, it will be sent only once.
When you press the "send every second" button, it will be sent automatically at 1 second intervals.

If there are multiple LAN ports on the PC, broadcasting will only be done on one LAN port with the highest priority.
If the packet does not arrive at the UECS node under such conditions, please perform to specify IP address and unicast transmission.
(If you want to broadcast to the intended LAN port, please unplug the other LAN ports)

●Send scaning command
Three kinds of commands can be sent.
· Node scan
Ask the UECS node connected in the LAN to respond.

· CCM scan
Request a list of CCMs that the node can send out.
If it over the packet size limit, it may be divided into multiple pages, so please specify the page number.

· CCM sender search
Search nodes with a specific CCM.
Please enter the CCM type you want to search in the request CCM column.

● Counting CCM traffic
From Ver2.2 onwards, you can display the packet traffic per minute.
It takes more than one minute for the value to be displayed after starting the software.
When measuring the traffic over 12000 packet / min, the display speed of the PC cannot keep up.
If you want to measure the packet flow rate of 12000 packets / min or more, check "Stop data port(UDP16520)" and stop the display.
Even if the display is stopped, only the packet distribution volume can be measured.


●"Output log to file" option
When this item is checked, a file called "receive.txt" is generated in the folder containing the executable file of this tool, and the received character string is written out sequentially.
